name: New country signIn with correct password
description: |
  'Identifies an interrupted sign-in session from a country the user has not sign-in before in the last 7 days, where the password was correct. Although the session is interrupted by other controls such as multi factor authentication or conditional access policies, the user credentials should be reset due since it could be considered compromise.'
